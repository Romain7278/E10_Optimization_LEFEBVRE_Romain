# Branch and Bound for Integer Linear Programming

## Overview

The implementation uses:
- **Branch and Bound Method**
- **Linear Programming Solving**

## Example

The script contains an example of an integer problem to solve at the end of the script:

```python
projects = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
revenues = [15, 20, 5, 25, 22, 17]
days = [51, 60, 35, 60, 53, 10]
max_days = 150
```
 You can add, modify and remove informations from this template to accomodate your needs.

## Requirements
